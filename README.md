Alexa Projects
--------------

## Setup ##

- Install apex
- Create profile 'alexa' in ~/.aws/credentials
- Deploy using apex deploy --region us-east-1

*Ask CLI Update*

I was looking for an easier way to version control and update skills and used apex. It seems Alexa dev console now available supports that use case as well. 

functions directory contains code for apex, while individual project directories contain code as cloned using the ask clone command. skills can be published using either.
